# Prompts for Structures
This project deals with the idea of using prompts for structured prediction tasks. The idea is to break a structured prediction tasks into independent components which can be queried to a language model using prompts. Following this, inference algorithms are used to enforce structural constraints for the structured prediction task in question.
